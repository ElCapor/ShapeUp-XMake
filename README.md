# ShapeUp

A 3D Modeling tool using constructive solid geometry. More information about the project [on my website](https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/shapeup/). This repo is a santitized copy of the original with commit history removed. I was never planning on doing a public release of this code, and I don't feel like auditing/changing the original repo's commit history for code/comments that shouldn't be public.  

This project is not maintained. This repo exists just because a few people said they were interested in looking at the code for educational purposes. I'm not accepting bug reports, feature requests, or PRs.
